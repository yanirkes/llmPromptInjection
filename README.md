This program serves as a tool for generating movie titles using LLN models while incorporating protection layers 
to identify prompt injection attacks. The system comprises three models:
1. The first model, a Naive approach, assesses similarity using a predefined corpus. It measures similarity via
   cosine similarity between the input and the established corpus.
   
2. Building upon the Naive model, the second model decomposes paragraphs into sentences, converting each sentence 
   into an embedding vector for comparison with the aforementioned corpus.
   
3. The final model utilizes a series of linked LLM models guided by predefined templates. The initial layer 
   summarizes the paragraph, it filters the text, scrutinizing it for indications of an 'attack'. The subsequent layer
   has to determine if the phrase attack appears in the previous layer.
   
Here are 4 examples of how the
