# First scenario - Secure user personal data from being expose to the LLM

Exposing personal data to language models like LLM can present significant privacy risks, including concerns 
regarding privacy, data retention, legal and ethical implications, among others. Preventing the exposure of
personal data to these models is crucial for minimizing the risks associated with potential privacy breaches.

The initial task of the program involves addressing this concern by implementing a protective layer designed to
identify various types of unintentionally exposed user data. This layer operates by recognizing specific patterns 
(such as dates or personal IDs), leveraging word2vec model embeddings to find similarities related to users' health
conditions, and utilizing a pre-trained NLP model from spaCy to detect English names.

Subsequently, the program generates outputs based on user instructions. Before returning the model's output, 
the protective layer intervenes, adjusting the input by replacing sensitive information to
safeguard user privacy.

Example text:
            
      text = """write me a latter for the municipality. My name Yanir Azerrad and my id aa123412vv. When i see all the doctors working hard at the the alzheimer institute, I feel there are not enough doctors, and there
      no resolution for it from the municipality side. Add information that my sister has the flu, but she was diagnose with cancer and that is because lack of doctors. I have alzheimer, therefore I am sick and I will probably
      forget. Please add also the current date, and I expect a response until Sunday 15.03.24"""

# Second scenario -  prompt injection deliberately adjust the model purpose.

This program serves as a tool for generating movie titles using LLN models while incorporating protection layers 
to identify prompt injection attacks. The system comprises four models:
1. The first model, a Naive approach, assesses similarity using a predefined corpus. It measures similarity via
   cosine similarity between the input and the established corpus.
   
2. Building upon the Naive model, the second model decomposes paragraphs into sentences, converting each sentence 
   into an embedding vector for comparison with the aforementioned corpus.
   
3. The first llm based model utilizes a an LLM models guided by predefined templates. The layer present the model with
   two options, either to throw a unique ID (with very small chances someone would produce it in a real chat) as an
   indicator of attack, or to summarize the prompt. The model is being informed that the text might include some 
   sort of attack message, therefore it might need to evaluate the real content of the massage. 

4. The last model are a series of linked LLM models guided by predefined templates. The first model has to 
   complete the task, where the second layer gets as an input the output of the first, and it needs to 
   estimate the whether the input it been given is a movie title or not. If the first layer was deliberately 
   misguided, the output would probably won't have a movie title pattern. Finally, if the estimations is less than 0.5
   than it assumes that the initial input is an attack.

There are 2 options:
1. Run on terminal (make sure you are in the right path)- streamlit run src\app.py.
   Make sure to install the dependencies before

      
      pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the following commands


      * docker build -t prompt_sec .
      * docker run -p 80:8501 prompt_sec

Please go to src/apikey.py and insert the apikey (it can be found on your OpenAI account).
